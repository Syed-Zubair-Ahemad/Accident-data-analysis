🚗 Accident Data Analysis Project 🚗
I'm excited to share my recent project on accident data analysis, where I leveraged Excel to uncover critical insights and trends. Here's a snapshot of what I accomplished:
🔍 Project Overview
In this project, I focused on analyzing accident data to identify trends and patterns that can help improve road safety and decision-making processes.
📊 Dashboard Highlights
I built an interactive Excel dashboard that:
•	Visualizes accident trends over time.
•	Highlights high-risk areas and accident hotspots.
•	Breaks down accidents by type, severity, and contributing factors.
🌟 Key Insights
•	Trend Analysis: Identified a significant increase in accidents during the rainy season, suggesting the need for better road safety measures during adverse weather conditions.
•	Hotspot Identification: Pinpointed specific intersections and road segments with higher accident frequencies, aiding in targeted infrastructure improvements.
•	Severity Breakdown: Analyzed the correlation between accident severity and factors such as time of day, vehicle type, and driver behavior.
💡 Actionable Recommendations
•	Enhanced Safety Measures: Suggested implementing better road signage and lighting in identified hotspots.
•	Seasonal Campaigns: Recommended seasonal safety campaigns to raise awareness during high-risk periods.
•	Data-Driven Policymaking: Encouraged the use of data insights to inform policy decisions and resource allocation.
This project underscores the power of data analysis in driving meaningful changes and improving public safety. I'm eager to continue exploring how data can be harnessed to solve real-world problems.
